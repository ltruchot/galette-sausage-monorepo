## About AI
- AI already saves (and destroys) lives, too late
- Today, AI consumes 500 TWh
  - 2030: 1500 TWh, India's current consumption, 5% of world consumption, IEA says
  - In 2050: 3500 TWh, singularity is coming
- AI steals jobs and makes you dumb

But,
- Just like the internet in general
- AI already improves 20 to 40% productivity AND efficiency/discovery rate in most domains it's applied: weather, research, medicine, smart homes and cities, administration, police, military, education...
- For coders, it's even more than 50%
- A full day chatting with ChatGPT uses 300,000 tokens, same CO2 as a Galette-Sausage, "all included"
- 90% of developers install an AI tool while installing an IDE
- 80% used it last week
- 50% of generated code is kept as is
- Big question: "Is it worth it?"

Let's try together with Claude Code
